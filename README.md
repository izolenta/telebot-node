### Commands

**/whoami** - displays information about your role (user/admin, currently does not affect anything) as well as about current mode (simple or context) and your AI assistant personality

**/context** - switches to context mode where ChatGPT is aware of previous chat context, and you can ask come corrective questions. Issuing this command creates a new context, also new context is created if you didn't send any messages within two hours. NOTE: in context mode all current context/chat history is being sent to OpenAI every time you send a message, so, since you pay for tokens, which are connected to words, you can spend a lot of $$ very quickly!

**/simple** - switches to simple mode, where ChatGPT is not aware of previous context/messages. Useful if you need to perform some one-time task. Takes much less $$.

**/setassistant** - sets your assistant personality. I.e. `/setassistant an assistant who is speaking like Master Yoda`

**/resetassistant** - clears your assistant personality and sets it to `a friendly personal assistant`

**/gpt3** - switches to gpt3 model

**/gpt4** - switches to gpt4 model (you need to have an API access to that!)
